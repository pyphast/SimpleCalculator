<h1 align="center">SimpleCalculator</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
This is my very first project created with python. The idea is based on a calculator that was created during my 4-week python training school. 
Everything has been built from scratch and new functionalities were learned through online research and implemented to fit my own approach.

<h3>Idea</h3>
The idea was to have a calculator with a bit more functionalities, as I was unhappy with the simplistic approach I learned on the training school.
Since this project is my first repository, I wanted to learn more than a bit of coding by also releasing and explaining my project. So of course learning basic Git operation was part of this project.
There are some more ideas for implementation on later basis.

<h3>Approach</h3>
I used Google Colaboratory for building the program and finished the last steps on PyCharm. I had to go with this somewhat unnecessary approach as I was writing my code at my workplace and finished it at home for the release.

<h3>Functionalities</h3>

- User input of numbers and operator
- Text based calculation with simple operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root and exponentiation)
- Help function for number and operator inputs
- Exit function to close program anytime
- Error handling of wrong inputs
- Restart function to run another calculation
