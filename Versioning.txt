Ver1:

Simple calculator with full functionality of calculating with basic operators

functionalities:

- input of two numbers and operator with input error check
- Calculating with operators such as +, -, *, /, square root, square number
- helping function for more information
- restart function to check if the user wants to do another calculation
- main program to run functionalities

Ver2:
- taken out redundand while loop in input function

Ver2.1:
- split input function into separate functions for input first number, operator and second number
- extract operator condition for second number to main programm to check if second number is needed (note need if operator is "*/")
- added seperate input functions to their own variables to be used for printing out calculation result
- added simple commentary for functions


Ver3:
- added calc_exit() function to allow closing program during run
- added condition that calls calc_exit() function when entering "exit" during input

Ver3.1:
- simplyfied print of calculation result by having the input results calculate inside of print function 
	without saving parameters inside an extra variable


Ver4:
- added .is_integer() function to run calculation as float but print out as integer if result is a whole number
- changed structure of input loops from "variable is None" to "while True"
- added .lstrip("-") function to accept minus signs in user input

Ver5:
- changed structure of program to separate files with imports to main program
- few pep 8 and code clean ups
